# Supervised Research Exposition

This repository focuses on Alan Turing's 1952 paper, *The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis*, where he proposed a mathematical model to explain how patterns such as stripes and spots emerge in biological systems. The repository contains both a detailed report and the code for simulating Turing's reaction-diffusion system, which demonstrates the formation of these patterns through the interaction of chemical substances called morphogens.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `Chemical_Basis_of_Morphogenesis.pdf`: A report detailing the theoretical background, model, and experiments based on Turing‚Äôs reaction-diffusion system.
- `Chemical_Basis_of_Morphogenesis.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing Python code to simulate the reaction-diffusion equations and visualize the results.

##  Key Concepts

The repository explains the following key concepts:

- **Morphogens**: Chemical substances that control the formation of patterns in biological organisms during morphogenesis.
- **Activator-Inhibitor Model**: A system where one substance (activator) encourages the production of another substance (inhibitor), which suppresses the activator, creating a feedback loop.
- **Reaction-Diffusion Systems**: Mathematical models describing how activator and inhibitor chemicals interact and diffuse through space, leading to pattern formation.
